# Contributing Your Own Recipes

TJ Bot is open source and we'd love to see what you can make with him. If you would like your recipe to be featured here, send us an email at tjbot@us.ibm.com.
Here are some ideas to get you started.

    - Visual recognition. TJ has a placeholder behind his left eye to insert a Raspberry Pi camera. Try connecting the camera to the Watson Visual Recognition API so TJ can say hello when he sees you.

    - IoT. The Watson IoT service lets you control smart home devices (e.g. Philips Hue, LIFX lights, etc. ). Connect TJ to IoT and have him control your home.

    - Connected robots. You can program multiple TJs to send messages to each other using the Watson IoT platform.

Submit a pull request for your receipe instructions and code and send a link to a demo video to tjbot@us.ibm.com (Vimeo & YouTube preferred). We will review it and if we decide to include it in our repository, you'll be listed as the developer.  Please note that all receipes will be published under the Apache 2.0 License. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

We cannot wait to see what you build with TJ!
